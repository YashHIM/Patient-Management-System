# Patient-Management-System
Patient Management System using JSP

I developed a Patient Management System in Java using Servlets and MySQL, featuring three modules: Admin, User, and Doctor. This system enables efficient appointment booking for both new and existing patients, streamlining the scheduling process. The Admin module manages user accounts and system configurations, while the Doctor module allows healthcare providers to view and manage patient appointments. The User module provides patients with a user-friendly interface to book and manage their appointments. This project enhanced my skills in Java, web technologies, and database management, and it demonstrates my ability to create functional, user-oriented software solutions for the healthcare sector.
